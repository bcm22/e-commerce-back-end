# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

In this project, I demonstrated my understanding of working on backend content. I proved that I can configure a working Express.js API and that I can use sequalize to interact with MySQL database. I also demonstrated how I can enter schema.sql and seed commands. I also wrote API routes to manipulate the database. You can GET, POST, PUT and DELETE different tables of data.

## Usage
